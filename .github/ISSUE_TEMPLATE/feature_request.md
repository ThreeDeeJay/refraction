#### Feature
A description of a feature.  
Example: would be cool to see X entity.

#### Suggestions
How can we implement such feature in the game?  
Example: there's an open implementation, go to Y.

#### Survey
My suggestion:
- [ ] Does _NOT_ require using any leaked (hence illegally distributed) source code. Referencing or researching it, howerer, is okay, I guess.
- [ ] Is technically possible by the limitations of Source Engine 2013 branch. If you are not sure, uncheck.
